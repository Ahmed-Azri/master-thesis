Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emergent architecture
that is dynamic, flexible, manageable and with low cost, 
consistent with the dynamics of modern applications.
This architecture decouples the control plane from the data plane.
Tipically, networks are represented as graphs.
Based on it, this master thesis presents a network 
representation model using a graph for the control plane 
of a SDN controller.
Our SDN solution adopts the OpenFlow protocol.
This project is based on POX, a SDN controller compatible 
with OpenFlow devices.
The graph aproach provides a global view of the network in real 
time and with consistency.
The experiments show that the graph is a reliable representation of 
the real network and its events occurring over time in the network,
thus easing the management in Software Defined Networking.
